# Linked Node
linked node is a often used data structure in leetcode.

```python

class ListNode:
     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
         self.val = val
         self.next = next

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children

```

It is widely used for Tree Search (BFS, DFS) challenge and also in some Two pointers challenge.
